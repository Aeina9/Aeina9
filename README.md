- Hi, Iâ€™m Amy Nguyen or @Aeina9, a senior computer science student at pursuing a BA in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota.
- I'm currently interested in developing my overall programming skills, and applying my studies to real-world applications!
- Practicing/learning: Python, HTML/CSS.
- Programming languages I have experience in: (Intermediate) C/C++ , (Basic) Python, Java, HTML/CSS
- Future ideas I want to try: Making a game!

- I've only recently started to do independent practice outside of schooling, and looking to do more!
- At the moment I am wanting industry experience. Just another student trying to make it.
